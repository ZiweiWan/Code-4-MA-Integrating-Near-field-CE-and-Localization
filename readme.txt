This simulation code package is mainly used to reproduce a part of the results of the following paper [1]：

[1] C. Sun, Z. Wan, L. Zhu, Z. Xiao, Z. Gao, and R. Zhang, "Movable antenna for integrating near-field channel estimation and localization," submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 2026.

Available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08357

steps:
1. run generate_channels.m 
2. run runner_4method.m 
3. run plot_antenna_ratio_comparison.m

Please note that the MATLAB R2024a is used for this simulation code package,  
and there may be some imcompatibility problems among different MATLAB versions. 

The results were verified on an Intel processor.
